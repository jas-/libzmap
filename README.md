# libzmap
[node.js](http://nodejs.org) bindings for the [zmap](https://zmap.io/) network scanning utility.

# installation
Some libraries are necessary for zmap to compile correctly, install these first.

Next clone this repo with the `--recursive` flag to include `zmap` as submodule.
```sh
%> git clone --recursive https://github.com/jas-/libzmap.git
```
