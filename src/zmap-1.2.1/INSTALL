SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ZMap is designed to run on GNU/Linux systems and can be built with
most recent versions of gcc. Currently, ZMap only supports 64-bit
systems. Running it requires at least 600 MB of free memory.

INSTALLING ZMAP

If you want to install it directly on Fedora 19+, just type

  yum install zmap

If you want to install it on Archlinux, please visit AUR link:

  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zmap/

BUILDING ZMAP

ZMap requires GMP, a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic,
gengetopt, and libpcap. ZMap also uses flex and byacc to generate the code for
the output filter lexer and parser. On Mac, ZMap uses libdnet for gateway and
route detection. These packages can be installed on Debian-based systems by
running:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgmp3-dev gengetopt libpcap-dev flex byacc

or on RHEL- and Fedora-based systems by running:

  sudo yum install gmp gmp-devel gengetopt libpcap-devel flex byacc
  
or on Mac OS systems (brew):

  brew install cmake gmp gengetopt json-c byacc libdnet

Once these prerequisites have been installed, ZMap can be installed
by running:

  cmake [-DWITH_REDIS=ON] [-DWITH_JSON=ON] [-DENABLE_DEVELOPMENT=ON] ./
  make

followed by:

  sudo make install

Enabling development turns on debug symbols, and turns off optimizations.
Release builds should but built with -DENABLE_DEVELOPMENT=OFF.

Redis support is not enabled by default. If you are want to use ZMap
with Redis, you will first need to install Hiredis. Then run cmake with
"-DWITH_REDIS=ON".

JSON support is not enabled by default. If you are want to use ZMap
with JSON output, you will first need to install json-c. Then, run cmake with
"-DWITH_JSON=ON".
 
Installing json-c from source requires git and autotools to be available. For
more information on how to install json-c, please see
http://github.com/json-c/json-c. If you are running on Ubuntu, these dependencies
can be installed by running:

  sudo apt-get install pkg-config libjson0-dev
